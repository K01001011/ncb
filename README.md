Demo app made for the Coffee Board of India  
  
Officers who go to the Coffee plantations in various regions can use this app to register complaints.  
The data entered by the officer is stored locally till the phone has access to an internet connection. Once the app has access to internet, the data is pushed to the online database where it is stored permanently.
